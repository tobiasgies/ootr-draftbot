# ootr-draftbot

This Discord bot will simulate a draft for Ocarina of Time Randomizer players. It can simulate both weekly / qualifier
style auto-drafts, as well as the 1v1 tournament-style drafts, where it will take the place of the opposing player.
This allows players to easily roll practice seeds for themselves. Because racing is fun, but sometimes, there's just no
opponent around.

This bot is a complement to the [racetime.gg Randobot](https://github.com/deains/ootr-randobot) draft implementation
and will closely track its changes.
